# Structure port validation

[Usage](STRUCTURES.md) | [中文](../zh-CN/STRUCTURES-VALIDATION.md)

Validated on 2026-11-04 against Java 25.0.3 and Paper 26.3 builds 202 and 238. Repository base: `a79ce3f8477db8e3ee25db563a611523218b78d3`. All runtime checks used isolated test worlds.

## Build and management

The repository Gradle suite and plugin builds pass: 454 recorded tests, 453 passed and one existing conditional skip, with no failures. All 98 frontend tests, Vite build and localization checks pass. All 2,148 files from the ten pinned upstream repositories match their source manifests.

Additional checks cover revisions, inheritance, failed atomic saves, preserved vanilla registry IDs, the actual 26.3 decorated-pot codec, template attributes and legacy setting fields. A read-only Web account received 403 for configuration/status endpoints; stale revisions were rejected. Browser checks exercised global and world saves, restored inheritance, restart status, Chinese/English and a 390px viewport.

## Live generation

Paper 238, seed `1234`: naturally locate each structure, generate its full footprint, then inspect native starts, blocks and block entities.

| Family | Pieces | Block entities |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Witch hut | 3 | 4 |
| Small dungeon | 5 | 9 |
| Oak mineshaft | 86 | 2 |
| Jungle temple | 42 | 67 |
| Stronghold | 918 | 385 |
| Desert temple | 460 | 211 |
| Ocean monument | 1,467 | 1 |
| Nether fortress | 661 | 66 |

All sampled blocks use the `minecraft:` namespace. Loot-bearing containers, spawners and witch-hut brewing contents were inspected. An unmodified official 26.3 client joined the local server and loaded structures. It used a local offline test account, without user account credentials.

On Paper 202 a witch hut survived saving, disabling its generation switch and restarting with identical structure/block-entity records. Dungeons and desert temples were also checked. A native Tectonic world with height 640, vertical scale 1.8 and horizontal scale 1.2 generated a 492-piece desert temple with 213 block entities. A fresh generation after the template fixes produced no Forge-attribute or decorated-pot decoding warnings.

The actual End fight controller completed both initial summoning and four-crystal resummoning in 605 accelerated stage updates, with exactly one dragon and ten vulnerable spike crystals without lingering beams. Restart preserved the dragon and kill counter. Gateway exit, return linkage and landing positions were checked. Accelerated stage execution is not a recording of a complete human-played fight.

### Extras and Bridges (Paper 26.3 build 238)

- Tested in new chunks of an existing overworld. With the switches on, a wishing well with `yungsextras:desert/extra_archeology`, swamp stone brick builds and river bridges generated. Across the same 542 swamp chunks in two worlds with one seed, the world with the switch on had 7 stone brick builds and the world with it off had none.
- A bridge at the write limit triggered `unsafe terrain read`. After the fix, the same region was deleted and regenerated from the same seed: the bridge still generated, with no `unsafe terrain read` or `far chunk` errors.
- Console dialog after saving: the X and Cancel leave the server running; Confirm restart restarts through `start.sh` and the new settings apply.
- Each of the 84 features was placed with `/place feature`. All placed successfully, with no exceptions in the log. More than 70,000 new chunks generated with the switches on contained no leftover markers such as `end_stone_bricks`, and the two stained glass colours found did not come from these features.
- Worlds created from one preset share a generator. Creating several normal worlds in a row no longer fails with `Feature order cycle`. The biome feature lists read at runtime show 16 desert and 46 swamp Extras features and river bridges in worlds with the switches on, and none in worlds with them off.
- Vanilla desert well: worlds with Extras on have no `minecraft:desert_well` in their feature lists, and worlds with it off do. Across the same 2,566 desert chunks with one seed, the world with it off had 1 vanilla well, and none of the 15 wells in the world with it on were vanilla.
- Tectonic worlds: the feature lists match normal worlds, and desert ruins, wishing wells, swamp stone brick builds and a bridge all generated. Bridges are clearly rarer: 1 in 1,340 river chunks, with about 1.7% of river chunks offering a valid site against about 5% in normal worlds, because gentle banks are less common.
- Without a `restart-script`: the dialog button becomes Confirm stop, and confirming stops the server without starting it again.

### Five-round in-game inspection (Paper 26.3 build 238)

- Five worlds were created with different seeds and Tectonic settings: official default, alpine, large biomes (underground rivers and lava tunnels off), monumental (height 1024) and overkill. Each round also had a Nether and an End world with the same seed.
- Each round located every structure, then a real client took screenshots from several angles, and every screenshot was reviewed. Only `small_nether_dungeon` was not located: it is off by default, as upstream. The overkill world has no mushroom mineshaft, and no mushroom fields were found in the search range.
- Two problems were fixed during the inspection, both in `GuardedFeature`. A Nether basalt feature reading a neighbouring chunk could look up a structure start outside the region and crash the server. Protection also covered single pieces only, so delta lava ate fortress bridge decks from the gaps between pieces. It now covers the whole structure box, as upstream does.
- After each fix, 2 new Nether worlds were created and fortresses were located twice in each. All 8 fortresses were correct. At the same seed and position, the deck had lava and magma before the fix and is intact after it.
- Round 1 overworld structures were generated before these fixes. Rounds 2 to 5 cover the fixed code.

## Vanilla comparison boundary

A same-seed Paper server without the structure plugin was compared with the plugin installed and every switch disabled. Desert, Nether and End 3×3 chunk samples contain **2,064,384** blocks: block hashes, biome hashes and structure starts matched exactly. The central witch-hut chunk also matched.

The surrounding swamp sample had small ore/stone overlap differences. Repeated unmodified Paper runs also reproduced that class of difference, including attempts with fixed requests and a single worker. [Paper #14125](https://github.com/PaperMC/Paper/issues/14125) documents generation-order-dependent decoration. The local result is consistent with that report, without claiming a proof for every differing block.

The original acceptance condition of universal, block-for-block identity for arbitrary fixed seeds is therefore **not marked fully passed**. This port does not alter Paper's decoration scheduler to impose a new generation order. With all switches off it retains the native noise generator and disables the nine custom structure families.

## Reproduction

See `DEVELOPMENT.en.md`. An already bootstrapped server can supply native dependencies through `-Plbr.paperServerHome=/absolute/path/to/paper-home`.

```sh
python3 tools/structures-probe/build.py /absolute/path/to/paper-home
```

The probe is console-only and restricted to `structures-*` test worlds; its binary is not shipped. `smoke` locates and checks natural structures; `fingerprint` hashes generated chunks; `end-cycle`, `end-resummon`, `end-status` and `gateway` inspect End behavior. `end-cycle` resets the test arena. These are acceptance commands, not production administration features.

Run `structuresprobe end-status minecraft:the_end` first to load the arena; without players, its entities may otherwise be unloaded. Portable generation counts and comparison hashes are in `plugin/validation/`.
